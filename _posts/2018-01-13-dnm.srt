2
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:38,163
- Get the briefcase, Rubecht.
<i>- Jawohl, Herr Colonel!</i>

3
00:00:38,341 --> 00:00:40,582
- Heil Hitler!
- Ja, Heil. Hurry,

4
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:42,765
I want to take off now!

5
00:00:50,476 --> 00:00:52,270
Hurry, Rubecht!

6
00:00:52,329 --> 00:00:54,179
Imbecile.

7
00:01:10,393 --> 00:01:12,379
Sleeping, Rubecht?

8
00:01:23,679 --> 00:01:25,410
You're asleep...

9
00:01:27,016 --> 00:01:28,850
You're not Rubecht!

10
00:01:28,929 --> 00:01:32,161
Not even German!
Give me the briefcase!

11
00:01:32,378 --> 00:01:35,876
I'll shoot out your legs
if you don't!

12
00:01:35,901 --> 00:01:38,208
- Never!
- Ridiculous...☻

13
00:01:39,151 --> 00:01:41,535
I have a gun. You don't.

14
00:01:45,534 --> 00:01:47,432
Imbecile!

15
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:54,700
Looking for this?

16
00:01:54,747 --> 00:01:57,974
- What do you want?
- The V2 plans.

17
00:01:58,036 --> 00:02:00,779
No way! You WILL fly me

18
00:02:00,849 --> 00:02:02,755
to South America!

19
00:02:02,807 --> 00:02:04,825
Or else, what?

20
00:02:04,927 --> 00:02:07,764
I'll jump,
and you won't get the plans!

21
00:02:07,850 --> 00:02:10,203
Which ones? These?

22
00:02:10,213 --> 00:02:11,403
Nein!

23
00:02:11,977 --> 00:02:13,478
Newspapers?

24
00:02:13,517 --> 00:02:15,404
Newspapers?!

25
00:02:16,148 --> 00:02:18,342
Who are you?

26
00:02:19,725 --> 00:02:23,107
OSS 117... At your service.

27
00:02:23,162 --> 00:02:26,008
I should have guessed! <i>Scheisse!</i>

28
00:02:27,159 --> 00:02:29,768
<i>Auf wiedershen, Herr Colonel!</i>

29
00:02:30,114 --> 00:02:33,688
And thanks for choosing
OSS 117 Airways!

30
00:02:39,350 --> 00:02:41,215
- OK, Jack?
- OK, Hubert.

31
00:02:41,292 --> 00:02:44,193
OK, then,
let's fly this plane!

32
00:02:46,259 --> 00:02:47,881
Coming.

33
00:03:06,696 --> 00:03:09,044
One thing puzzles me, Jack.

34
00:03:09,092 --> 00:03:12,169
Why not give him the case
if you'd removed the plans?

35
00:03:12,215 --> 00:03:14,270
I never yield to barbarism.

36
00:03:14,317 --> 00:03:16,348
Yeah, just like me!

37
00:05:19,229 --> 00:05:21,088
- You dog!
- Tsk, tsk.

38
00:05:21,181 --> 00:05:24,442
Let's start off easy,
before spicing things up.

39
00:05:24,505 --> 00:05:27,815
I saw right through
your treachery.

40
00:05:27,865 --> 00:05:29,450
No kidding?

41
00:05:29,521 --> 00:05:33,200
You're French secret service.
Agent OSS 117.

42
00:05:33,262 --> 00:05:36,880
You're numbered like a cow
to be slaughtered.

43
00:05:37,016 --> 00:05:38,849
At your service.

44
00:05:39,121 --> 00:05:40,871
And I know who you are.

45
00:05:40,936 --> 00:05:44,355
Not Jamila Naroubi;
Lebanese journalist, in Rome,

46
00:05:44,356 --> 00:05:47,400
but Princess Al Tarouk;
niece of Egypt's King Farouk.

47
00:05:47,401 --> 00:05:50,192
I am Farouk's niece,
but he' isn't king.

48
00:05:50,254 --> 00:05:53,356
He was exiled 3 years ago
by that vile Nasser!

49
00:05:53,401 --> 00:05:55,947
May he die an
agonizing death. Dog!

50
00:05:55,972 --> 00:05:59,898
Gross language for a lady
whose unky is a Pharaoh!

51
00:05:59,948 --> 00:06:04,329
My uncle is 'King'.
Pharaohs reigned 4000 years ago!

52
00:06:05,085 --> 00:06:06,868
I knew that.

53
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:09,019
In any case, Princess...

54
00:06:09,070 --> 00:06:11,372
you have something
I really need.

55
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:14,357
Pig, you'll pay
for your treachery!

56
00:06:14,428 --> 00:06:15,929
We'll see about that.

57
00:06:16,005 --> 00:06:19,377
Before you go, filthy spy,
make love to me.

58
00:06:19,408 --> 00:06:21,700
- I think not.
- Why not?

59
00:06:21,746 --> 00:06:23,491
Not in the mood.

60
00:06:24,039 --> 00:06:28,632
- Didn't like the crack about cows.
- OK, I take it back. - Thank you.

61
00:06:28,756 --> 00:06:30,600
No... Tied up.

62
00:06:32,391 --> 00:06:34,853
- Gagged?
- Yes.

63
00:06:47,628 --> 00:06:49,292
Mm, mhmm.

64
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:52,295
Mm, mhmm!

65
00:06:52,497 --> 00:06:53,895
Hm?

66
00:06:54,021 --> 00:06:55,716
Mm, mhmm!

67
00:06:58,115 --> 00:06:59,935
Come here, viper!

68
00:07:00,101 --> 00:07:03,946
OK, but, let's make it a quickie.
I only have a few hours.

69
00:07:17,575 --> 00:07:20,944
- How's your veal stew?
- The stew's good.

70
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:27,004
How's your veal stew?

71
00:07:27,029 --> 00:07:30,615
The stew's good.
Nice to see you, Hubert.

72
00:07:30,669 --> 00:07:34,013
- Here's what you wanted.
- Let's see.

73
00:07:38,853 --> 00:07:40,455
My God!

74
00:07:40,521 --> 00:07:43,222
- What is it?
- Very bad news.

75
00:07:45,620 --> 00:07:47,216
Jack!

76
00:07:51,251 --> 00:07:52,817
Jack...

77
00:08:18,275 --> 00:08:20,090
Jack...

78
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:27,368
- Jack.
- OSS 283 was our agent in Egypt.

79
00:08:27,728 --> 00:08:29,937
We had no news for a month.

80
00:08:30,187 --> 00:08:31,572
Now, I see why.

81
00:08:31,632 --> 00:08:33,999
- What's going on there?
- A mess.

82
00:08:34,068 --> 00:08:37,398
The Soviets and Americans
want a punch-up

83
00:08:37,446 --> 00:08:41,124
The English want to
hang onto Suez at any cost.

84
00:08:41,125 --> 00:08:44,163
To top it all, a Russian
cargo ship disappeared,

85
00:08:44,217 --> 00:08:45,896
last month. The "Kapov".

86
00:08:45,927 --> 00:08:47,927
Almost forgot the Eagles of Kheops.

87
00:08:47,981 --> 00:08:49,755
- The...?
- Eagles of Kheops.

88
00:08:49,806 --> 00:08:52,036
Religious extremists who want
to take over the country.

89
00:08:52,087 --> 00:08:54,226
-What a cocktail!
- Hubert...

90
00:08:54,281 --> 00:08:58,181
Egypt's situation worries
our top level. - President Coty?

91
00:08:58,206 --> 00:09:00,308
Yes, President Coty.

92
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:08,391
So, you gonna eat?

93
00:09:08,453 --> 00:09:11,115
- How's your veal stew?
- It's good. - Hubert?

94
00:09:11,140 --> 00:09:12,853
Two veals and
Beaujolais Brouilly.

95
00:09:12,892 --> 00:09:15,283
I hear good things about
your Kipper and Spuds.

96
00:09:15,299 --> 00:09:18,113
I'll bring you a ramekin
see for yourself.

97
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:21,075
We need you on the spot.

98
00:09:21,198 --> 00:09:24,271
A specialist in the
Arabo-Muslim world.

99
00:09:24,372 --> 00:09:26,465
- Arabo... ?
- Muslim.

100
00:09:27,326 --> 00:09:29,589
Find out what
Jefferson discovered

101
00:09:29,630 --> 00:09:32,115
- And who killed him.
- You can count on me.

102
00:09:32,177 --> 00:09:35,097
Find a way
to calm everybody down:

103
00:09:35,191 --> 00:09:38,047
Americans, Soviets, English...

104
00:09:38,090 --> 00:09:42,172
bolster the French position,
restore peace in Egypt. - Sure.

105
00:09:42,227 --> 00:09:45,107
- Secure the Middle East.
- No problem.

106
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:49,154
Your contact will meet you at
Cairo airport, by the globe map.

107
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:52,292
- Usual procedure?
- Usual procedure.

108
00:09:55,649 --> 00:10:00,014
You're Lucien Bramard, businessman.
Jack Jefferson's associate.

109
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:04,407
Welcome to Cairo, OSS 117, realm of
pharaohs and mysterious tombs

110
00:10:04,467 --> 00:10:06,888
and a veritable nest of spies.

111
00:10:06,935 --> 00:10:09,654
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to Cairo.</i>

112
00:10:26,712 --> 00:10:28,683
OK, he just arrived.

113
00:10:48,661 --> 00:10:50,916
How's your veal stew?

114
00:10:51,007 --> 00:10:52,466
Pardon?

115
00:10:52,541 --> 00:10:54,093
Your meat dishes,

116
00:10:54,156 --> 00:10:56,711
are they of good quality?

117
00:10:58,589 --> 00:11:00,220
Yeah...

118
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,674
Good?

119
00:11:03,175 --> 00:11:05,564
If you like meat, yeah.

120
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:06,881
With veal?

121
00:11:06,929 --> 00:11:09,536
No, lamb, I think.

122
00:11:09,974 --> 00:11:11,294
There's chicken too.

123
00:11:11,326 --> 00:11:15,616
Anything with veal?
With mushrooms, potatoes...

124
00:11:16,673 --> 00:11:18,101
I don't know.

125
00:11:18,166 --> 00:11:19,766
Goodbye, monsieur.

126
00:11:19,858 --> 00:11:21,758
Good day, monsieur.

127
00:11:26,462 --> 00:11:29,154
How is your veal stew?

128
00:11:37,011 --> 00:11:38,436
It's good!

129
00:11:38,483 --> 00:11:41,552
I hear good things about
your Kipper and Spuds.

130
00:11:41,615 --> 00:11:44,997
The landlord'll bring you
a ramekin, see for yourself.

131
00:11:45,044 --> 00:11:47,945
Larmina El Akmar Betouche,
Jack Jefferson's secretary.

132
00:11:47,970 --> 00:11:50,773
Complicated name.
Hubert Bonnisseur de la Bath.

133
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:52,583
But, here, I'm Lucien Bramard.

134
00:11:52,622 --> 00:11:54,166
- Enchanté.
- Enchantée.

135
00:11:54,190 --> 00:11:57,700
Let's be off.
This airport is a nest of spies.

136
00:12:12,369 --> 00:12:15,052
- Cigarette?
- No, I don't smoke.

137
00:12:15,165 --> 00:12:16,994
Never liked it.

138
00:12:17,048 --> 00:12:21,146
Too bad. Smoking is relaxing.
Especially in your line of work.

139
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,762
I know, it bugs me.

140
00:12:22,787 --> 00:12:24,798
It kills me being a non-smoker.

141
00:12:24,799 --> 00:12:28,021
I'll give smoking another try,
I promise.

142
00:12:28,516 --> 00:12:30,316
Nice car.

143
00:12:31,696 --> 00:12:33,396
Shame it's so dirty.

144
00:12:33,450 --> 00:12:35,493
There's lots of dust in our country.

145
00:12:35,548 --> 00:12:37,092
To say the least!

146
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:40,705
People schlepping around
chickens and watermelons...

147
00:12:41,424 --> 00:12:43,691
Still, basically it's simpatico.

148
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:45,318
Simpatico?

149
00:12:45,692 --> 00:12:46,990
Simpatico!

150
00:12:47,044 --> 00:12:49,364
Egypt ruled the world for 2000 years.

151
00:12:49,411 --> 00:12:52,283
We invented
astronomy and mathematics.

152
00:12:52,309 --> 00:12:56,365
Our architects built sanctuaries
that still baffle archeologists today,

153
00:12:56,411 --> 00:12:58,729
M. Bonnisseur de la Bath!

154
00:13:00,705 --> 00:13:03,447
Bramard. Lucien Bramard.

155
00:13:07,188 --> 00:13:08,886
Your French is irreproachable.

156
00:13:08,926 --> 00:13:12,133
Egypt has long been francophone,
but the Rais...

157
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:14,481
- The who?
- Rais. The leader.

158
00:13:14,576 --> 00:13:17,379
The president of Egypt.
Nasser.

159
00:13:18,102 --> 00:13:21,014
Nasser launched a policy
of Arabicization.

160
00:13:21,110 --> 00:13:24,069
The problem with Arabic
is it's illegible.

161
00:13:24,154 --> 00:13:26,444
Even the sounds are...

162
00:13:28,115 --> 00:13:30,110
Actually it's lovely. Really lovely.

I had a mouse in my bed
and a cockroach in the cupboard.

323
00:26:20,634 --> 00:26:22,829
I'll take care of it, <i>sidi</i>.

324
00:26:24,005 --> 00:26:25,263
<i>Aiwa?*</i> (Yes?)

325
00:26:25,310 --> 00:26:27,991
He's leaving the
Metropolitan hotel.

326
00:26:28,364 --> 00:26:31,284
<i>- Salaam Aleikum, Lucien.</i>*
- Good evening, Larmina.

327
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:33,000
You were LOVELY this afternoon.

328
00:26:33,031 --> 00:26:34,490
You're GORGEOUS tonight.

329
00:26:34,529 --> 00:26:35,987
Can't wait to see you tomorrow!

330
00:26:36,010 --> 00:26:37,809
<i>Insh Allah*</i> Shall I drive?
(God willing)

331
00:26:37,864 --> 00:26:40,087
I can't refuse a
dark-eyed brunette.

332
00:26:40,112 --> 00:26:41,821
If I were blonde and blue-eyed?

333
00:26:41,822 --> 00:26:44,365
Either way, you're my type
of woman, Larmina.

334
00:26:44,411 --> 00:26:47,603
Really? What if I were
a myopic midget?

335
00:26:49,750 --> 00:26:51,873
I wouldn't let you drive.

336
00:26:52,941 --> 00:26:54,771
It'd make no sense.

337
00:27:09,558 --> 00:27:12,675
Go in, Larmina.
I'll rejoin you later.

338
00:27:17,191 --> 00:27:19,177
OK, now I've got it.

339
00:27:19,581 --> 00:27:21,583
How's your casserole?

340
00:27:22,822 --> 00:27:25,068
- Didn't have enough, before, huh?
- (Stop!)

341
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,966
YOU, stop it!

342
00:27:36,425 --> 00:27:37,878
Pardon me.

343
00:27:37,923 --> 00:27:39,978
Come, let's have some fun.

344
00:27:40,062 --> 00:27:42,601
He just arrived at the Embassy.

345
00:27:58,030 --> 00:28:00,583
A Suze*. (bitters)
Anything for you?

346
00:28:00,638 --> 00:28:03,554
Guignolet? Dubonnet? Cinzano?
Brandy, perhaps?

347
00:28:03,642 --> 00:28:05,515
I don't drink alcohol.

348
00:28:06,141 --> 00:28:07,654
What an odd notion!

349
00:28:07,692 --> 00:28:09,629
It's forbidden by my religion.

350
00:28:09,654 --> 00:28:13,835
What religion would be so stupid as to
deprive its faithful of such a pleasure?

351
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:15,229
The Muslim religion,

352
00:28:15,249 --> 00:28:18,200
to which 90%
of this country belongs.

353
00:28:18,950 --> 00:28:20,630
I didn't know that.

354
00:28:20,942 --> 00:28:22,513
My bad.

355
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,414
You're very...

356
00:28:30,723 --> 00:28:33,016
Very French, all in all.

357
00:28:34,104 --> 00:28:35,789
Thank you.

358
00:28:50,117 --> 00:28:51,963
Oh, a mambo!

359
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:53,985
Come on!

360
00:28:54,947 --> 00:28:56,498
I don't know this dance.

361
00:28:56,529 --> 00:28:59,119
Watch my feet and do like me.

362
00:29:10,638 --> 00:29:13,737
I'm a sort of
mirror image of you.

363
00:29:13,849 --> 00:29:16,229
Say, I'm delighted with
my reflection.

364
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:17,769
I'm lovely tonight.

365
00:29:17,831 --> 00:29:21,517
That dress shows my gorgeous shape
with a soupcon of modesty.

366
00:29:21,556 --> 00:29:23,675
Be quiet and concentrate.

367
00:29:29,818 --> 00:29:31,699
Lucien, a little discretion!

368
00:29:31,731 --> 00:29:34,998
How can I be discreet with
a woman like you?

369
00:29:42,106 --> 00:29:44,411
Come back, without you, I feel...

370
00:29:44,524 --> 00:29:45,919
All naked?

371
00:29:45,988 --> 00:29:47,817
I understand.

372
00:29:51,178 --> 00:29:53,137
You see those men?

373
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:59,287
- A pretty clique!
- They're the ones, you should sleuth.

374
00:29:59,307 --> 00:30:00,975
I'll introduce you.

375
00:30:31,723 --> 00:30:33,048
Come, Lucien.

376
00:30:33,073 --> 00:30:36,411
Plunge with me into the
troubled waters of the Nile.

377
00:30:37,099 --> 00:30:40,552
This is M. Jefferson's associate,
Lucien Bramard.

378
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:43,115
Lucien, Gerhard Moeller.
You've already met.

379
00:30:43,161 --> 00:30:45,231
Nice to see you again,
M. Bramard.

380
00:30:45,232 --> 00:30:47,275
My pleasure, <i>Herr</i> Moeller

381
00:30:47,371 --> 00:30:51,761
Raymond Pelletier, SBEP: Syndicate
of Belgo-Egyptian Poultry Producers.

382
00:30:51,845 --> 00:30:54,105
Our competitor and friend.

383
00:30:54,825 --> 00:30:57,065
- Raymond Pelletier. Hello.
- Enchanté.

384
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:00,371
And Yeveni Setine.
He raises sheep.

385
00:31:00,372 --> 00:31:01,581
Enchanté.

386
00:31:01,706 --> 00:31:03,878
M. Bramard. Cigarette?

387
00:31:03,912 --> 00:31:05,925
Thanks. I've been meaning to start.

388
00:31:05,950 --> 00:31:08,642
- Mademoiselle?
- Thank you.

389
00:31:19,558 --> 00:31:22,148
- May I?
- Be my guest.

390
00:31:22,404 --> 00:31:26,081
I'd be delighted to show you
the pyramids, M. Bramard.

391
00:31:26,146 --> 00:31:28,716
It's an honor to
have such a guide.

392
00:31:28,818 --> 00:31:31,242
A philosopher once said,
the pyramids' mystery

393
00:31:31,252 --> 00:31:33,974
is as impenetrable as
the mystery of consciousness.

394
00:31:34,012 --> 00:31:36,865
Pharaohs were buried
with their servants.

395
00:31:36,917 --> 00:31:39,816
When we die, we want
everything else to stop.

396
00:31:39,870 --> 00:31:42,337
But, it's the cycle of life.

397
00:31:43,332 --> 00:31:46,440
When someone or something dies,

398
00:31:47,442 --> 00:31:50,348
something or someone
is born, elsewhere.

399
00:31:50,448 --> 00:31:53,077
We try to forget we're animals,

400
00:31:53,205 --> 00:31:55,183
but nature reminds us.

401
00:31:55,256 --> 00:31:57,255
Sometimes cruelly.

402
00:32:08,781 --> 00:32:13,051
Scientists experiment
on fruit flies (drosophilia*)

403
00:32:13,487 --> 00:32:16,679
because their brain structure
is very close to ours.

404
00:32:16,704 --> 00:32:20,242
A horse sees us as bigger than
we are, with its anamorphic eye.

405
00:32:20,293 --> 00:32:23,553
That's why we were able
to domesticate them.

406
00:32:25,341 --> 00:32:27,044
Our eyes and our outlook

407
00:32:27,126 --> 00:32:30,157
which dictate our
behaviour towards others.

408
00:32:30,254 --> 00:32:32,512
But we can be myopic.

409
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:37,131
Ah!

410
00:32:37,862 --> 00:32:40,951
The blind man doesn't see.
He feels.

411
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:42,974
And paradoxically, he sees.

412
00:32:43,014 --> 00:32:45,790
If a cat's tail is vertical,

413
00:32:46,228 --> 00:32:47,763
it feels at ease.

414
00:32:47,855 --> 00:32:50,029
Amputees' legs still itch.

415
00:32:50,128 --> 00:32:53,171
When women dump men,
they change hairstyles.

416
00:32:53,235 --> 00:32:56,303
You must let a baby cry at night,

417
00:32:56,725 --> 00:33:00,209
otherwise its bedtime
becomes too ritualized.

418
00:33:09,421 --> 00:33:10,757
Hm!

419
00:33:13,214 --> 00:33:16,831
Shall we have a drink?
Something from the bar, hm?

420
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:21,035
A little nightcap.

421
00:33:24,580 --> 00:33:26,690
- Mister Bramard?
- Yes.

422
00:33:32,357 --> 00:33:34,841

423
00:33:37,857 --> 00:33:39,490
Excuse me.

424
00:33:48,415 --> 00:33:52,466
Nigel Gardenborough.
Head of the British Lamb Consortium.

425
00:33:52,536 --> 00:33:55,005
Lucien Bramard.
What does this mean?

426
00:33:55,073 --> 00:33:57,904
It means, I know who you are. - Ah!

427
00:33:57,997 --> 00:34:00,302
I tried contacting you several times.

428
00:34:00,341 --> 00:34:03,200
But you're a bit of a hothead.

429
00:34:03,401 --> 00:34:05,986
Pardon me.
Can't be too careful.

430
00:34:06,058 --> 00:34:08,306
This city is a nest of spies.

431
00:34:08,462 --> 00:34:12,259
- What did you want?
- To warn you of great danger.

By the way, Larmina

469
00:39:26,841 --> 00:39:30,131
I was awakened by a guy
screaming his guts out, up a tower.

470
00:39:30,132 --> 00:39:32,919
Impossible to sleep.
I had to shut him up.

471
00:39:32,968 --> 00:39:35,637

You shut up a muezzin?

- Muezzin.

I didn't know.

475
00:39:41,750 --> 00:39:46,068
So, that's what that racket was.
The screaming, the mike...

476
00:39:47,652 --> 00:39:50,268
I still maintain it's
a curious religion.

I'm sure you'll all be

Sure, Lucien.

482
00:40:06,468 --> 00:40:08,517
<i>Lashukran.*</i>
(don't thank me)

483
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:16,480
OK.

484
00:40:16,720 --> 00:40:19,164
See you later...

485
00:40:50,337 --> 00:40:52,575
Intercalary...

486
00:41:03,730 --> 00:41:06,921
[ Chickens and Eggs ]

487
00:41:43,008 --> 00:41:45,350
Will you need me
for anything else?

488
00:41:45,351 --> 00:41:48,031
- It's five o'clock, <i>sidi</i>
- Five o'clock?

489
00:41:48,944 --> 00:41:50,461
How time flies!

490
00:41:50,767 --> 00:41:53,726
No, you can go home,
my good man. - Thank you <i>sidi</i>.

491
00:41:53,817 --> 00:41:55,294
Goodnight, Slimane.

492
00:41:55,380 --> 00:41:57,107
- Slimane?
- Yes, <i>sidi</i>.

493
00:41:58,197 --> 00:42:00,615
Kiss your family for me, OK?

494
00:42:00,699 --> 00:42:03,117
How many kids you got?
Eight? Nine?

495
00:42:03,305 --> 00:42:04,871
Two, <i>sidi</i>.

496
00:42:06,252 --> 00:42:07,983
Kiss them anyway.

497
00:42:10,946 --> 00:42:12,351
Thank you, <i>sidi</i>.

498
00:42:12,438 --> 00:42:14,376
<i>Slama*, sidi</i>.
(Goodbye)

499
00:42:28,143 --> 00:42:29,819
Slimane?

500
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,915
Is that you, Slimane?

501
00:42:43,885 --> 00:42:45,604
Slimane?

502
00:43:10,769 --> 00:43:12,626
My God!

503
00:43:47,221 --> 00:43:48,858
You OK, Lucien?

504
00:43:48,915 --> 00:43:50,519
Fine!

505
00:43:53,854 --> 00:43:55,563
I though it would sting.

506
00:43:55,626 --> 00:43:57,521
Normally, yes.

507
00:43:59,504 --> 00:44:01,006
May I?

508
00:44:01,124 --> 00:44:03,905
Let's not waste time
with this nonsense.

509
00:44:05,407 --> 00:44:07,632
- You OK, Lucien?
- Fine.

510
00:44:10,616 --> 00:44:12,478
(What an idiot!)

511
00:44:16,115 --> 00:44:18,290
You're lucky it's just scratches.

512
00:44:18,331 --> 00:44:20,193
It could get infected.

513
00:44:23,592 --> 00:44:25,786
I don't like this, at all.

514
00:44:26,384 --> 00:44:29,023
As if business isn't
bad enough, already.

515
00:44:29,063 --> 00:44:31,521
We lost 25 chickens
in this deal.

516
00:44:31,583 --> 00:44:34,521
Look at what I found in
your assailant's pocket.

517
00:44:34,583 --> 00:44:36,943
My God, "Fondouk"!
Ring any bells?

518
00:44:37,005 --> 00:44:39,154
- It's a café.
- Anything special about it?

519
00:44:39,253 --> 00:44:41,531
No, nothing. Very typical.

520
00:44:42,144 --> 00:44:43,739
Too bad.

521
00:44:43,946 --> 00:44:46,224
It could've been a clue.

522
00:44:47,772 --> 00:44:50,188
Even so, it may be worth
dropping by.

523
00:44:50,259 --> 00:44:51,603
You never know.

524
00:44:51,745 --> 00:44:54,070
To find a clue or a lead.

525
00:44:55,503 --> 00:44:58,341
You're right.
That's exactly what I think.

526
00:44:58,419 --> 00:45:01,646
Teach me some basic Arabic,
so I'll blend in.

527
00:45:01,711 --> 00:45:03,849
Very well. Let's start
at the beginning:

528
00:45:03,928 --> 00:45:06,060
<i>waheed, zhush,
thalatha, arba'a, hamsa.</i>

529
00:45:06,115 --> 00:45:08,946
- <i>waheed, zhush, tleita,
arba'a, hamsa.</i> - Very good.

530
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:11,521
- What's it mean?
- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

531
00:45:14,768 --> 00:45:16,594
It's of no use to me.

532
00:45:19,481 --> 00:45:21,742
Unless I need to count to five.

533
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:24,367
Then it might come in handy.

534
00:45:25,809 --> 00:45:29,817
I mustn't go past five
because at "six" I'm done.

535
00:45:32,139 --> 00:45:33,632
Let's give it a try.

536
00:45:33,663 --> 00:45:35,522
It's worth a shot, Larmina.

537
00:45:35,588 --> 00:45:38,144
Yes, worth a shot.

538
00:45:38,482 --> 00:45:40,490
<i>- Salaam.
- Salaam.</i>

539
00:46:39,103 --> 00:46:41,950
<i>My brothers! My brothers!</i>

540
00:46:42,165 --> 00:46:44,497
<i>In the name of God most merciful</i>

00:46:47,528 --> 00:46:49,615
<i>They flout our God</i>

00:46:49,697 --> 00:46:51,732
<i>and repudiate Islam!</i>

544
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:54,806
<i>This morning they
obstructed a muezzin</i>

545
00:46:54,831 --> 00:46:56,935
<i>in the performance of his duty.</i>

546
00:46:56,996 --> 00:47:00,184
<i>It is a sign from above
to take up arms!</i>

547
00:47:00,299 --> 00:47:02,431

- <i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

548
00:47:02,794 --> 00:47:04,775

00:47:05,150 --> 00:47:07,221
- <i>Allahu Akbar!</i>
- <i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

550
00:47:07,757 --> 00:47:09,674
<i>Yes, my brothers, </i>

551
00:47:09,800 --> 00:47:11,759
<i>we will take up arms.</i>

552
00:47:11,786 --> 00:47:13,751
- <i>Allahu Akbar!</i>
- <i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

553
00:47:14,372 --> 00:47:16,337
- <i>Allahu Akbar!</i>
- <i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

00:47:19,059 --> 00:47:20,560
<i>Yes, my brothers,</i>

556
00:47:20,561 --> 00:47:23,404
<i>by attacking the muezzin this morning</i>

557
00:47:23,513 --> 00:47:26,591

558
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:28,443

562
00:47:41,749 --> 00:47:43,501
<i>The infidel is among us. </i>

563
00:47:43,563 --> 00:47:45,360
<i>Brothers... </i>

564
00:47:45,410 --> 00:47:47,119
<i>The atheist infidel</i>

565
00:47:47,254 --> 00:47:48,755

567
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,775
- <i>It is him!</i>
- <i>Allahu Akbar!</i>

568
00:48:06,732 --> 00:48:09,010
Oh, my head!

569
00:48:12,701 --> 00:48:14,812
My wrists...

570
00:48:18,452 --> 00:48:20,119
Why are you here, foreign dog?

571
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,957
I avoid tourist traps. Your café
seemed authentic and the menu tasty.

572
00:48:23,958 --> 00:48:27,835
A few whip lashes and you'll
lose your arrogance, infidel.

573
00:48:27,836 --> 00:48:31,787
Untie me, I'll let you feel
my arrogance, Fidel.

574
00:48:32,720 --> 00:48:37,200
<i>waheed, zhush, tleita,</i>

575
00:48:37,712 --> 00:48:40,440
<i>arba'a, hamsa...</i>

576
00:48:42,935 --> 00:48:44,750
...Six.

577
00:49:08,711 --> 00:49:10,253
Larmina?

578
00:49:10,254 --> 00:49:12,911
Trapped like a rat, OSS 117.

579
00:49:13,215 --> 00:49:16,843
How could you betray me?
I should've never trusted you.

580
00:49:16,844 --> 00:49:19,501
You can never trust a woman!

581
00:49:19,597 --> 00:49:23,850
To think I almost let you
make love to me, now I'm fairly screwed!

582
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:25,768
Make love to you?

583
00:49:25,769 --> 00:49:29,522
You, who silenced a muezzin
because he interfered with your sleep!

584
00:49:29,523 --> 00:49:32,845
I'd rather fornicate with
a pig on a Ramadan Friday!

585
00:49:33,944 --> 00:49:37,655
You incessantly judge my country
and religion with smug pretention.

586
00:49:37,656 --> 00:49:39,574
I can't believe it. You...

587
00:49:39,575 --> 00:49:43,870
with your cigarettes, your mambo,
your tits, in this gang of fanatics!

588
00:49:43,871 --> 00:49:46,247
I told you, but you didn't listen.

589
00:49:46,248 --> 00:49:48,822
My father was a saint of a man.

590
00:49:49,126 --> 00:49:51,813
If he hadn't had that terrible
jokari accident,

591
00:49:51,826 --> 00:49:53,713
he'd be leading the revolution!

592
00:49:53,714 --> 00:49:56,257
- You're not like those men.
- I'm just like them.

593
00:49:56,258 --> 00:49:58,551
I fight for respect.

594
00:49:58,552 --> 00:50:00,678
Too bad they're not like you.

595
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:05,141
If all men had your shape
I'd definitely switch teams.

596
00:50:05,142 --> 00:50:08,333
I warn you, never talk about
my body!

597
00:50:09,396 --> 00:50:12,255
If men had your round breasts,

598
00:50:12,900 --> 00:50:15,068
your impeccable cleavage,

599
00:50:15,069 --> 00:50:18,988
nipples that perk up
at the slightest emotion or breeze

600
00:50:18,989 --> 00:50:21,699
the sort of nipples you want to nibble...

601
00:50:21,700 --> 00:50:25,437
so pink with life,
engorged with desire...

602
00:50:25,538 --> 00:50:26,746
You're ridiculous Lucien.

603
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:29,404
Yes... but I'm free!

604
00:50:32,962 --> 00:50:35,380
OK... I'm off.

605
00:50:35,381 --> 00:50:37,173
What're you gonna do?

606
00:50:37,174 --> 00:50:41,457
Just kidding. So long, Larmina.
<i>Insh Allah.</i>(God willing)

607
00:50:42,805 --> 00:50:44,916
I'm such a card!

608
00:50:47,643 --> 00:50:49,310
Oh yes, I'd forgotten.

609
00:50:49,311 --> 00:50:51,980
So, infidel, leaving without
saying 'au revoir'?

610
00:50:51,981 --> 00:50:54,482
Not at all. I'm ready to tell you
'au revoir', one at a time.

611
00:50:54,483 --> 00:50:57,852
- Try it and see...
- Who wants to start?

612
00:51:04,994 --> 00:51:06,939
Try it and see...

613
00:51:07,538 --> 00:51:09,483
Who wants to start?

614
00:51:11,041 --> 00:51:15,075
So, infidel, leaving without
saying 'au revoir'?

615
00:51:15,212 --> 00:51:18,119
In polite society one never
overstays one's welcome.

<i>Gimme that, I'll row.</i>

622

Good evening.

623
00:53:57,708 --> 00:54:00,116
Any messages?

624
00:54:03,255 --> 00:54:05,840
Fine.

625
00:54:05,841 --> 00:54:08,201
I'll go up to my room.

626
00:54:19,396 --> 00:54:21,231
He just got back to the hotel.

627
00:54:21,232 --> 00:54:24,400
<i>OK. You can stop following him now.</i>

00:54:38,582 --> 00:54:40,693
<i>And he has a pistol,</i>

Hubert, old chap.

640
00:55:19,123 --> 00:55:21,650
Plantieux, good to see you!

641
00:55:22,001 --> 00:55:24,658
- How long has it been?
- Too long!

642
00:55:25,296 --> 00:55:28,747
Like I always say,
when it's long, it's too long.

643
00:55:35,514 --> 00:55:37,874
- On the rocks?
- On the rocks!

644
00:55:46,734 --> 00:55:48,714
Funny...

- To our colonial empire!
- To our colonial empire!

646
00:55:58,871 --> 00:56:02,496
There's unrest here, in Algeria,
Morocco, Tunisia...

647
00:56:02,497 --> 00:56:04,751
the fall of Dien Bien Phu.

648
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:08,158
Believe me, Hubert, France will
soon regain the upper hand

649
00:56:08,159 --> 00:56:10,319
- and keep its colonies!
- <i>Insh Allah,</i> Plantieux.

- How far did you get?
- Nowhere.

651
00:56:12,551 --> 00:56:16,786
I searched the SCEP and found
nothing but chicken receipts.

652
00:56:16,847 --> 00:56:18,828
What's your take on it?

653
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,400
I redid the books.
They're not wonderful,

654
00:56:21,505 --> 00:56:23,927
but, it has potential.

655
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,000
You realize, Plantieux, two years ago,

656
00:56:26,005 --> 00:56:28,681
our largest competitor, SBEP,
had 85% of the local market.

657
00:56:28,865 --> 00:56:30,681
Now we're ahead of them.

658
00:56:35,241 --> 00:56:37,200
Actually...

659
00:56:37,201 --> 00:56:40,985
I wanted your take on
Jefferson's death.

660
00:56:41,580 --> 00:56:43,957
Ah, Jack... yeah, sure.

661
00:56:43,958 --> 00:56:46,531
I still don't know who did it.

662
00:56:46,627 --> 00:56:49,070
Believe me, if I knew...

663
00:56:51,173 --> 00:56:52,952
Thanks.

664
00:56:53,175 --> 00:56:55,025
What's this?... Jack's writing.

665
00:56:55,046 --> 00:56:58,345
The "Kapov" is the Russian ship
that disappeared last month.

666
00:56:58,346 --> 00:57:00,249
If he wrote it down,
it must be important.

667
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,749
It's a clue!

668
00:57:02,142 --> 00:57:04,611
I keep finding matchbooks.

669
00:57:04,612 --> 00:57:07,367
This one, I found on
the chicken-chucker.

670
00:57:07,372 --> 00:57:09,377
It led me straight to the...

671

- The Eagles of...
- Kheops? - Yes!

673
00:57:15,865 --> 00:57:18,449
Another clue. Good job.
Hats off to you.

674
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:20,495
I was in a crowd clamoring
for revolution,

675
00:57:20,500 --> 00:57:22,264
but, now that they're getting arms...

676
00:57:22,276 --> 00:57:24,688
The Eagles of Kheops,
are getting arms?

677
00:57:25,416 --> 00:57:26,996
- Yes.
- Extremely worrisome.

678
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,696
You warn the Egyptian government,
I'll tell Paris.

679
00:57:31,046 --> 00:57:32,505
Well done, old chap.

680

Intuition, discretion, deduction:
pure OSS 117!

681
00:57:36,326 --> 00:57:39,429
You just have to think
and not get sidetracked.

682
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:42,166
Talk to that Russian, Setine.

683
00:57:42,230 --> 00:57:46,166
You'll find him at the Soliman
Pasha Hammam* (steam bath) - OK.

684
00:57:47,605 --> 00:57:49,467
Get me Paris. Code red.

00:57:53,777 --> 00:57:55,722
I'm off.

686
00:57:56,405 --> 00:57:59,810
What did you tell me to do
before the hammam*? (steam bath)

687
00:58:00,117 --> 00:58:02,857
- The government.
- The government...

688
00:58:02,870 --> 00:58:04,352
Of Egypt.

689
00:58:05,873 --> 00:58:08,032
OK, right.

690
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:10,826
Well, I'm off.

691
00:58:12,421 --> 00:58:14,580
Au revoir, Plantieux.

M. Bonisseur de la Bath. Thank you.

694
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,369
We'll act immediately.

695
00:58:44,370 --> 00:58:45,787
It seemed the obvious thing to do.

The Eagles of Kheops want to
plunge us into the Middle Ages.

Yesterday's regrettable, unforgiveable
incident with the muezzin

Lovely fountain!

00:59:03,681 --> 00:59:06,836

How flattering to see

that I share this narguile*. (hookah)

709
00:59:40,301 --> 00:59:42,176
Our country's development

710
00:59:42,177 --> 00:59:46,681
and the modern era we opened up
have created envious, bitter opposition.

711
00:59:46,682 --> 00:59:50,685
Not only the Eagles of Kheops,
but that degenerate royal family.

712
00:59:50,686 --> 00:59:55,550
Who never accepted the removal
of that inept pervert, Farouk.

713
00:59:56,650 --> 00:59:59,360
The royal family may be degenerates, but

714
00:59:59,361 --> 01:00:02,138
I assure you, Princess Al Tarouk
is worth making a detour.

715
01:00:02,139 --> 01:00:05,616
When she gets busy, she checks
her royal blood at the door.

My God, she screeches like a fishwife!

So...

Getting back to the situation in Egypt.
Development, modernization: fine, but

- Sorry?

Just the canal, if you please!

01:00:36,941 --> 01:00:39,150
If the French and the English
weren't running it, I mean...

722
01:00:39,151 --> 01:00:41,152
Just look at the mess
on the streets!

723

01:00:59,129 --> 01:01:01,454
Time to grow up.

of chicken, what a mess!

- Never the right papers.
- Enough!

Because our countries are allies,
you're not rotting in jail!

731
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:23,555

732

It's a good thing
you came to see me, M. Bramard.

736
01:01:36,625 --> 01:01:39,365
Especially since your skin
is so dry.

01:01:39,461 --> 01:01:41,241
Really?

738
01:01:41,380 --> 01:01:43,131
I'd advise you to moisturize.

739
01:01:43,132 --> 01:01:46,405
Hydrate your skin,
let it penetrate deeply.

740

This is delicious.

741

I love being buttered up.

01:01:56,437 --> 01:02:01,554
- Got something to tell me, Lucien?
- Yes, "Kapov". Ring any bells?

Kapov?

Could it be my country's ship
that disappeared last month?

745
01:02:10,242 --> 01:02:13,369
M. Bramard, I'll leave you

He's the tall one.
The other is Loktar.

750
01:02:23,714 --> 01:02:27,467
Khalid mixes two traditional
massage methods:

751
01:02:27,468 --> 01:02:30,429
shiatsu, to work out the
nervous blood

752
01:02:30,430 --> 01:02:33,088
and Nuan Thai for stretching.

753

Oh, yes, it's astounding!

754
01:02:35,726 --> 01:02:39,344
Khalid is a master; a <i>"maalem"</i>,
as they say, here.

01:02:39,647 --> 01:02:41,231
It's bracing.

756
01:02:41,232 --> 01:02:43,493
Would you like to prolong
the massage

757
01:02:43,494 --> 01:02:46,527
- or will you to talk to me?
- Talk about what?

758
01:02:46,528 --> 01:02:48,488
Your associate, Jefferson.

759

- Jack's at a meeting, abroad.
- Enough games, Bramard!

You're no more into poultry

with its cargo of arms.
The next day,

763
01:02:59,583 --> 01:03:02,460
Jefferson disappears, too.
Strange, no?

764
01:03:02,461 --> 01:03:06,798
My sole concern, Setine, is to
develop my chicken activities.

a matchbook with "Kapov"
written in it. Odd, no?

768
01:03:13,889 --> 01:03:17,141
My ambition is to break into
the Syrian and Jordanian markets.

769
01:03:17,142 --> 01:03:21,187
Enough, Bramard!
Or should I say, OSS 117?

770
01:03:21,188 --> 01:03:23,481
Where's the Kapov?
Where are the arms?

771
01:03:23,482 --> 01:03:26,590
Where's Jefferson?
Three questions.

772
01:03:28,654 --> 01:03:30,599
One answer.

01:03:30,614 --> 01:03:32,345
Two answers.

And three answers.

What do you want, Moeller?

781
01:04:25,544 --> 01:04:29,589
That excursion to the pyramids

Yes, with pleasure.

Good.

Want me to drop you at your hotel?

786
01:04:39,558 --> 01:04:44,338
I'd sooner be dropped off at the SCEP
I have a little more work to do.

I dunno... Nothing?

791
01:05:34,113 --> 01:05:36,948
Frightful thing that happened

792
01:05:36,949 --> 01:05:39,558
They say crazy things about him.

793
01:05:40,077 --> 01:05:43,872
They say his morals were,
to say the least, ambiguous.

794
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:46,958
Particularly in the hammam
where you met.

795
01:05:46,959 --> 01:05:48,738
Did you know?

796
01:05:49,003 --> 01:05:50,545
No, I had no idea.

797
01:05:50,546 --> 01:05:54,757
Strange. Still, they say
that you and he...

798
01:05:54,758 --> 01:05:56,467
Yeah, well, I didn't know!

799
01:05:56,468 --> 01:05:58,711
And I prefer it that way.

800
01:05:58,871 --> 01:06:03,459
As for me, men should go with women.
The rest is perversion and mental illness.

801
01:06:03,560 --> 01:06:07,134
- Let's say no more.
- I totally agree.

802
01:06:10,983 --> 01:06:14,277
[ <i>Entrance to Pyramids</i> ]

803
01:06:14,278 --> 01:06:18,643
<i>Herr</i> Bramard, you'll see,
it's quite impressive.

804
01:06:18,991 --> 01:06:20,854
Come.

805
01:06:24,705 --> 01:06:26,915
This sudden intimacy suits me fine.

806
01:06:26,916 --> 01:06:28,791
I have 2 or 3 questions for you.

807
01:06:28,792 --> 01:06:31,169
What do you know about the Kapov
and what happened to Jefferson?

808
01:06:31,170 --> 01:06:35,340
You disappoint me <i>Herr</i> Bramard.
I thought you were intersted in pyramids.

809
01:06:35,341 --> 01:06:37,675
Well, I'm not.
I couldn't give a rat's ass.

810
01:06:37,676 --> 01:06:42,013
You're wrong about that. Deep inside
they reveal all their riches.

811
01:06:42,014 --> 01:06:43,431
Where are you taking me, Moeller?

812
01:06:43,432 --> 01:06:46,338
Don't worry, <i>Herr</i> Bramard.

813
01:06:53,192 --> 01:06:55,434
Great God, what the...!

814
01:06:56,553 --> 01:06:59,772
<i>Heil Hitler, Heil Hitler, Heil Hitler!</i>

815
01:07:00,115 --> 01:07:03,104
What's this masquerade, Moeller?

816
01:07:03,869 --> 01:07:06,746
Colonel Moeller,
Officer of the Wehrmacht.

817
01:07:06,747 --> 01:07:09,985
Welcome among us, OSS 117.

818
01:07:11,877 --> 01:07:15,672
I've been waiting a long time
for this moment. 10 years, exactly.

819
01:07:15,673 --> 01:07:19,676
Since the day you murdered my friend,
Colonel von Umsprung.

820
01:07:19,677 --> 01:07:21,302
- Von... ?
- Umpsprung.

821
01:07:21,303 --> 01:07:23,930
Colonel Hermann von Umsprung,
Waffen SS.

822
01:07:23,931 --> 01:07:27,183
- Can't place him.
- Sure. Tall... dark hair.

823
01:07:27,184 --> 01:07:30,979
I tell you, Moeller, I've killed
so many Nazis, I've lost count.

824
01:07:30,980 --> 01:07:33,523
On the up-side, each one was
a great pleasure.

825
01:07:33,524 --> 01:07:35,504
Hermann...

826
01:07:38,460 --> 01:07:39,990
Hermann...

827
01:07:44,034 --> 01:07:45,897
Take that!

828
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:51,124
Is that what you call hitting it...

829
01:07:51,125 --> 01:07:52,738
hard?

830
01:07:54,295 --> 01:07:56,240
Hermann...

831
01:07:56,389 --> 01:07:58,858
Not a day goes by,
when I don't think of him.

832
01:07:58,869 --> 01:08:02,537
Since you threw him out over Berlin.
- Oh, him!

833
01:08:03,429 --> 01:08:05,847
- He had the V2 plans?
- Voila.

834
01:08:05,848 --> 01:08:09,058
Oh, OK, now I see,
I see, absolutely, yes, yes.

835
01:08:09,059 --> 01:08:12,478
We took his plans and gave them
to the Americans. - Voilà!

836
01:08:12,479 --> 01:08:13,771
Tall guy, dark hair.

837
01:08:13,772 --> 01:08:15,607
- Voilà!
- Sympatico.

838
01:08:15,608 --> 01:08:18,651
Exactly.
Hermann von Umpsrung, my friend.

839
01:08:18,652 --> 01:08:21,392
Yes, Hermann, absolutely.
Nice mission, by the way.

840
01:08:21,697 --> 01:08:23,808
Nice mission, yep.

841
01:08:24,825 --> 01:08:27,285
My God, so it was you
who killed Jefferson!

842
01:08:27,286 --> 01:08:30,455
Unfortunately, no.
Someone else beat me to it.

843
01:08:30,456 --> 01:08:33,528
But I'll make up for it,
with you.

844
01:08:33,792 --> 01:08:36,169
- You should tie him up, Colonel.
- Shut up, Loktar!

845
01:08:36,170 --> 01:08:38,046
- You?
- You know each other, I believe.

846
01:08:38,047 --> 01:08:40,840
- Hello, 117!
- I should've guessed.

847
01:08:40,841 --> 01:08:43,810
You're not only a coward,
you're a traitor,

848
01:08:43,813 --> 01:08:45,219
as your small size indicates.

849
01:08:45,221 --> 01:08:48,765
What are you, huh?
What are you? <i>Nardim amouk. </i>

850
01:08:48,766 --> 01:08:50,558
Silence, Loktar!

851
01:08:50,559 --> 01:08:53,528
- Where's the Kapov, Bramard?
- I won't tell you a thing, Moeller.

852
01:08:53,529 --> 01:08:57,511
The 3rd Reich and Nazis ideology
have always left me sceptical.

853
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,529
Bla, bla, bla, bla.

854
01:08:59,860 --> 01:09:03,229
Funny, how the Nazis
are always the bad guys.

855
01:09:03,239 --> 01:09:06,241
It's 1955, <i>Herr</i> Bramard.

856
01:09:06,242 --> 01:09:09,869
Can we get a second chance?
... Thank you...

857
01:09:09,870 --> 01:09:12,362
- You should tie him up, Colonel.
- Enough, Loktar!

858
01:09:12,363 --> 01:09:14,864
Shut up, or I'll shut you up.

859
01:09:15,834 --> 01:09:18,836
You're just tolerated here.
Tolerated!

860
01:09:18,837 --> 01:09:21,798
I'm a little embarrassed, because

861
01:09:21,799 --> 01:09:25,260
I can't say "Talk or I'll kill you"

862
01:09:25,261 --> 01:09:29,246
because I'll be killing you anyway.
For Hermann, you see.

863
01:09:29,598 --> 01:09:32,308
But, perhaps this

864
01:09:32,309 --> 01:09:34,836
will motivate you to help me.

865
01:09:37,168 --> 01:09:38,341
<i>Oh, Scheisse!</i>

866
01:09:43,612 --> 01:09:46,864
So <i>Herr</i> Bramard,
what's you decision?

867
01:09:46,865 --> 01:09:50,401
The arms, or your secretary?

868
01:09:50,578 --> 01:09:53,604
Mademoiselle El Akmar Betouche
is no longer part of SCEP.

869
01:09:54,349 --> 01:09:57,360
Yes, yes. How does she look?

870
01:10:00,462 --> 01:10:02,881
Do you want me to undress her
before my men?

871
01:10:02,882 --> 01:10:05,870
Do as you please.
I'm not attracted to that woman.

872
01:10:07,195 --> 01:10:09,919
Oh, silly me!

873
01:10:12,600 --> 01:10:16,768
No doubt, it would have been easier
with <i>Herr</i> Setine in her place.

874
01:10:16,769 --> 01:10:20,056
The one who, so expertly,
fondles little weenies.

875
01:10:20,057 --> 01:10:21,858
What weenies?! Whose weenie?

876
01:10:21,859 --> 01:10:24,770
- "I love being buttered up."
- I never said that!

877
01:10:24,771 --> 01:10:27,895
- I saw you!
- Stop talking nonsense.

878
01:10:31,577 --> 01:10:34,995
- Total nonsense.
- <i>Ach, Herr</i> Bramard!

879
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:43,109
Let me show you something,
<i>Herr</i> Bramard.

880
01:10:47,927 --> 01:10:50,000
You see these screens?

881
01:10:50,006 --> 01:10:53,348
It's a surveillance system.
Highly sophisticated.

882
01:10:53,349 --> 01:10:55,591
This system is simply amazing.

883
01:10:55,684 --> 01:11:00,252
Machines that allow you to record
images on magnetic tapes.

884
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:06,724
I call them 'record-o-scopes'.

885
01:11:09,073 --> 01:11:10,935
Loktar...

886
01:11:14,328 --> 01:11:17,234
Once the screens warm up
we'll be able to...

887
01:11:17,581 --> 01:11:20,238
- Adieu, Moeller.
- What the ...?!

888
01:11:22,538 --> 01:11:23,995
<i>Scheisse!</i>

889
01:11:24,138 --> 01:11:27,095
I told you to tie him up, Colonel.

890
01:11:27,132 --> 01:11:29,775
And I told you to shut up!

891
01:11:31,428 --> 01:11:32,720
How did you do that?

892
01:11:32,721 --> 01:11:37,440
Ma chère, when you're interested
in a culture, you learn the language.

893
01:11:39,053 --> 01:11:42,511
In this situation,
it happens to be hieroglyphs.

894
01:11:43,357 --> 01:11:45,358
How do we get out of here?

895
01:11:45,359 --> 01:11:48,111
We'll never get out of here.

896
01:11:48,112 --> 01:11:51,267
No one ever got out of here!

897
01:11:51,991 --> 01:11:54,909
The Pyramid of Kephren
will be our tomb!

898
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:57,912
All they'll find, in 150 years
will be our skeletons.

899
01:11:57,913 --> 01:12:00,123
Walled in for life! For life!

900
01:12:00,124 --> 01:12:03,501
Condemned to eat our fingers,
our feet, our clothes!

901
01:12:03,502 --> 01:12:05,533
We're all going to die!

902
01:12:05,546 --> 01:12:07,028
Coming, Larmina?

903
01:12:17,266 --> 01:12:19,475
Thank you, M. Bramard,
you saved my life.

904
01:12:19,476 --> 01:12:23,227
I didn't save you. I couldn't stand
that fascist's allegations

905
01:12:23,228 --> 01:12:25,344
about my sexuality. It's different.

906
01:12:25,482 --> 01:12:27,567
How are your friends,
the Eagles of Kheops?

907
01:12:27,568 --> 01:12:29,944
Fine, thanks.
They're fighting for a good cause.

908
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:31,460
A good cause?

909
01:12:31,465 --> 01:12:36,066
Worth throwing me into the Suez canal
among a forest of skeletons?

910
01:12:36,619 --> 01:12:38,184
By the way...

911
01:12:42,917 --> 01:12:46,521
Here's the jokari I found
around your father's neck.

912
01:12:49,640 --> 01:12:52,514
Your father was influential,
a saintly man.

913
01:12:52,768 --> 01:12:56,257
This was definitely no ordinary
paddle ball accident.

914
01:12:56,731 --> 01:12:59,574
Come, we have an hour's hump
by dromedary.

915
01:13:03,771 --> 01:13:05,103
Don't cry Larmina.

916
01:13:05,111 --> 01:13:08,303
Rather, try to figure out
who profited from the crime.

917
01:13:24,611 --> 01:13:25,603
- Good evening, <i>sidi.
- Assalamu aleikum</i>

918
01:13:25,611 --> 01:13:27,603
<i>- Ma assalaam
- Hatha sali?</i>

919
01:13:28,611 --> 01:13:30,603
<i>- Un shouilla.
- Ushe gava?</i>

920
01:13:30,611 --> 01:13:33,603
<i>- 'Ham du li'llah, ani?
- Be 'aa. - Hashem zii.</i>

921
01:13:33,611 --> 01:13:34,603
<i>- Ana melfik.
- 'Ham du li'llah.</i>

922
01:13:43,561 --> 01:13:47,511
<i>When I say: "Stop following him"
I really mean "Stop following him."</i>

923
01:13:48,232 --> 01:13:50,971
<i>Not "Keep following him."</i>

924
01:13:51,735 --> 01:13:55,187
<i>Otherwise I'd say
"Keep following him."</i>

925
01:14:12,631 --> 01:14:15,905
Lucien, I...
I've thought it over.

926
01:14:16,677 --> 01:14:20,179
Only one man could hate my father.
The Imam of the Eagles of Kheops.

927
01:14:20,180 --> 01:14:23,308
- The I... ?
- Mam. The old man at the Fondouk*. (café)

928
01:14:23,309 --> 01:14:25,310
I'll kill him
with my own two hands.

929
01:14:25,311 --> 01:14:27,896
Calm down Larmina. You can't
kill people on a whim.

930
01:14:27,897 --> 01:14:31,152
I'm sorry about the other night
at the Fondouk*. (café)

931
01:14:31,409 --> 01:14:32,984
I'm not sorry.

932
01:14:32,985 --> 01:14:35,737
What I saw there
made up for the torture.

933
01:14:35,738 --> 01:14:38,763
Even if the worst torture of all
was not seeing more.

934
01:14:39,033 --> 01:14:40,450
Lucien, you're embarrassing me.

935
01:14:40,451 --> 01:14:42,811
- Flatterer.
- Flatterer.

936
01:14:43,688 --> 01:14:44,681
Well...

937
01:14:45,497 --> 01:14:49,042
Larmina, the Eagles of Kheops
are getting arms.

938
01:14:49,043 --> 01:14:53,087
And Setine the Soviet said the Kapov
disappeared with its cargo of arms.

939
01:14:53,088 --> 01:14:55,631
Seems to me, a lot of arms,
all at the same time.

940
01:14:55,716 --> 01:14:57,696
Undoutedly the same arms.

941
01:15:00,221 --> 01:15:01,387
Possibly.

942
01:15:01,388 --> 01:15:03,223
But there are troubling things
in this business.

943
01:15:03,224 --> 01:15:06,851
Jefferson's killed and writes
in a matchbook: "Kapov."

944
01:15:06,852 --> 01:15:09,395

1092
01:26:07,972 --> 01:26:09,931
OSS 283 is dead.

1093
01:26:09,932 --> 01:26:11,766
- But you're not dead?
- No.

1094
01:26:11,767 --> 01:26:16,229
I never imagined you were alive.
In fact I thought you were dead.

1095
01:26:16,230 --> 01:26:18,064
I was pretending to be dead.

1096
01:26:18,065 --> 01:26:20,176
Oh, my God!

1097
01:26:22,286 --> 01:26:24,701
- Then, it was you who...?
- Yes.

1098
01:26:26,323 --> 01:26:28,399
But I was sure you were dead.

1099

Jack... my friend. My brother.

1100

Your friend?

That's not how I remember it.

You've been trounced, Jack!

You don't know how to play, Jack! You stink!

- Jack!
- Hey?

1106
01:26:59,432 --> 01:27:03,005
No, it's not how
I remember it, at all.

1107
01:27:04,820 --> 01:27:06,279
Why are you doing this, Jack?

1108
01:27:06,280 --> 01:27:08,889
Money, Hubert. A lot of money.

1109
01:27:09,867 --> 01:27:12,952
President Coty's smile
isn't enough to live on.

1110
01:27:12,953 --> 01:27:15,860
Lots of money, thanks to that!

1111
01:27:17,541 --> 01:27:19,751
- Please...
- Just a second, hm?

1112
01:27:19,752 --> 01:27:22,295
- Can I have my arms?
- They're there.

1113
01:27:22,296 --> 01:27:26,049
I'm fed up with your back story.
I want my arms and I wanna kill him.

1114
01:27:26,050 --> 01:27:29,038
- This is my point.
- We're coming to that.

- See, Larmina, he's not dead!

1120
01:27:46,111 --> 01:27:47,237
I was sure of it.

Seems the SCEP personnel
is all here.

1122

Who'll be first?
The secretary or the director?

1123
01:27:51,442 --> 01:27:53,899
Drop your weapon, Jefferson!

1124

Dog! We had an agreement, yet
you deal with the Eagles of Kheops.

The Imam upped the bid.
Now, I'm open to offers.

1126

Here's my offer.

1127
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:06,047
Take it or leave it.

The problem with women is,

I said enough!

Stop!

Enough!

Now, Princess, tell me exactly...

We have a boat to neutralise.

Voilà, Larmina.

1142

Peace is restored.

1143
01:30:16,762 --> 01:30:20,913
Peace will reign over your country
for centuries to come.

1144

Larmina, I meant to tell you...

01:30:30,442 --> 01:30:33,468
I may have shocked you
a couple of times.

1146

Yes.

My obsession for clean automobiles,

and the fact that I don't smoke
may have irked you.

Be that as it may, I learned
something, thanks to you.

You still have a few
little things to learn.

Good to see you, Hubert.
How's the veal stew?

It's good.

I'm so happy.
Your mission was a success.

Good work, OSS 117.

1164

I just did my duty.

- What?

That weenie business. They're asking
about it at the top levels.
