<p>The domain is between 25$^\circ$E to 28$^\circ$E and 35$^\circ$N to 38$^\circ$N. Total grid points are 1400x1500 points in x-and y-directions respectively.
   The grid spacing is approximately 250 meter in both directions. There is 1   
isopycnic layer in GOLD with RK3 time method and PPM continuity. No Laplacian   
or Biharmonic viscosity used in the simulation.</p>
